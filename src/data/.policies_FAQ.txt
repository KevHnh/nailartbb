Policies
Thank you for choosing me as your nail technician here are my policies that will help your appointment (and my day) run smoothly

Other Salons Work:
To guarantee consistency retention, and quality of the final set I do not offer fills or removals on work done by another salon. Please come with bare nails!

I require a $50 deposit through Zelle in order to keep your appointment

Please understand that when you forget or cancel your appointment without giving enough notice, I miss the opportunity to to fill that appointment time, and clients on my waiting list miss the opportunity to recieve services. Since the services are reserved for you personally, if you don't show up, you will not recieve your deposit back. No charge for over 5 hours of notice. Multiple no shows will reult in permanent termination

Arriving Late 

Appointments are booked back to back in a time sensitive manner, Therefore, late arrivals of 10 minutes or more may result in rescheduling, or adjustin gthe service altogether. If its your first time coming, please make yourself familiar with the area well before your appointment. I understand that situation may come up, but it will be up to my discretion if the service can be completed at that time. I cannot guarantee your service can be completed if you are late, if this is the case you will need to reschedule your appointment and will be charged the full price for the service missed. If you are going to be late, PLEASE LET ME KNOW AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE by emailing me at bb.love.nails92@gmail.com

No Children Please:

Please find arrangements for childcare, do not bring them to your scheduled appointment. My studio is equipped with chemicals, expensive equipment and small objects that are not appropiate for children to be around. It is distractiong for me to do my work, and need all of my attention on you. If you bring your child your appointment will be cancelled on the spot and you will not recieve your deposit back. It will count as a "no show" for the service missed

Refunds 

I have a no refund policy on services completed in the salon. However, if for any reason you are unhappy with the service you received, please notify me immediatley! I would be more than happy to make the matter right, either by fixing, or correcting a service. I offer complimentary fixes within 48 hours of completion

I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING FREQUENT CANCELLATIONS, NO SHOWS, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE POLICIES I HAVE INPLACE FOR MY BUSINESS. I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION WITH MY POLICIES.

HYGENIC SERVICES

It is the most important commitment for me as a responsible beauty professional to take pride in
keeping a clean sanitized work environment by using
Hospital-grade disinfectant Barbicide products for proper
sanitization of all implements and surfaces, after each
and every client.
All Metal Instruments used in any services (nailclippers, cuticle pushers, cuticle bits, etc) areguaranteed to be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected aftereach service by hospital grade disinfectantswhich contain AHP (accelerate HydrogenPeroxide) to eliminate bacteria, germs, and viruses such as Hepatitis B.

All Non-Metal Tools : Every nail service includesyour own individual nail file which is used at yourappointment. It will be disposed of after eachservice. 

My nail space area is located in 117 9th st, Brooklyn Ny 11215. There is a code that will be emailed to you on the day of the appointment (this code changes daily) 
Its such a great vibe in the shop I can't wait to show you the space. I love to match my clients energy, if you feel like chatting I would love to get to know you better, or if this is your down time I offer "silent appointments" where if you prefer have quiet time or don't feel like talking and would prefer to listen to a podcast I am happy to accommodate the appointment tailored to you. Whichever mood you're in - I am so happy to see you and make you feel fabulous

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
I get a lot of questions, if you have a question see if it is answered on here first. If not, I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have.

WHAT KIND OF EXTENSIONS DO YOU DO? 
I do gel X and japanese gel. 

WHAT IS JAPANESE GEL? 
100% Gel, None of the Other Stuff
Japanese gels are true gels (as opposed to gel polish) because they are not being diluted by nail polish which makes them highly-pigmented and durable. Gel polish must be soaked off with acetone after every service, while Japanese gel can be soaked off OR filled in depending on your service. Japanese gels are great because they have the dual use of being used for nail art and full applications.

HOW LONG WILL THEY LAST? 
2-6 weeks, depending on your life style. Remember, nails are not tools. 

WHEN SHOULD I DO MY REFILLS?
Every two weeks is recommended, if you take longer than 2 weeks, a $10 fee will be added to cover the cost of product. More space to fill more product it takes and more time. 

SHOULD I TAKE A BREAK FROM MY GEL POLISH SO MY NAILS CAN BREATHE?
Your nails are dead material (keratin) which is the same protein as your hair. They are dead skin cells. Therefore they do not need oxygen to breathe. Whatever you do, DO NOT peel or rip off your enhancements, this is extremely damaging to your nails. I recommend getting your enhacements removed by a professional. 

WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GEL POLISH AND SHELLAC?
Shellac IS a gel polish. Shellac is just the Brand of a Gel polish Line. Think of it like Coke vs Pepsi, they are basically the same thing but just different brand names. Shellac is just a well known BRAND of GEL POLISH. I currently do not offer shellac nail products, I have a variety of different Gel Polish brands. 

HOW LONG DOES THE APPOINTMENT TAKE?
It depends on shape, length, and the nail design. I book two and a half hours for a full set of nails depending the art, Generally, a gel fill with nail art is about 2 hours or plus depending on design. Fills take less time because there is already product on the nail from your previous appointment. Good nails take time and attention to detail, and I take pride in the nails that I create. PLEASE ALLOT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT IN YOUR SCHEDULE. 

WHY DO GEL NAILS TAKE SO LONG?
I want you to be satisfied with your nails, so I take extra care and attention to details so you leave happy. I provide a russian style manicure to the eponychium and depending on the art it will take some time. 

WHY DOES THE GEL GET HOT WHEN ITS CURING?
The reason SOME people may feel a heat spike when the gel is in the LED light is because that is the moment the Gel is changing state, from a liquid to a solid. The molecules are changing, and as they change, they heat up. If you feel a heat spike, it only lasts for 1-3 seconds, after that it is done. I tell all my clients to REMOVE your hand from the light as soon as you feel it getting even a little warm, You do not need to bear thru it, we can just cure it again (it wont heat up again, only the 1 time as it hardens).
