              Appointments are booked back to back in a time sensitive manner.
              Therefore, late arrivals of 10 minutes or more may result in
              rescheduling, or adjusting the service altogether.

              If it’s your first time coming, please make yourself familiar with
              the area and/or transportation routes before your appointment. I
              understand that situations may arise, but it will be up to my
              discretion if the service can be completed in the event that you
              are over 10 minutes late.

              I cannot guarantee your service can be completed if you are late,
              if this is the case you will need to reschedule your appointment
              and will be charged the full price for the service missed. If you
              are going to be late, PLEASE LET ME KNOW AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE by

              that are not safe or appropiate for children to be around. If you
              bring your child, your appointment will be cancelled on the spot
              and you will not recieve your deposit back. It will count as a "no
              show" for the service missed.

              to make the matter right, either by fixing, or correcting a

              My nail studio is located at 117 9th st, suite 239, Brooklyn Ny
              11215. There is a code that will be emailed to you on the day of
              the appointment (this code changes daily). I try to create a
              pleasant ambience in the studio and cater to your mood. If you
              feel like chatting I would love to get to know you better. If this
              is your down time and you prefer quiet, or to listen to a podcast
              or music, I offer “silent appointments”. Whatever get you the most
              comfortable, I am happy to accommodate.
