              If this is your first visit, please take time to familiarize yourself with the area and plan your route in advance. While I understand that delays can happen, it is at my discretion whether the service can still be completed if you arrive more than 10 minutes late

              Please note: I cannot guarantee your service if you arrive late. If you arrive more than 10 minutes late, you will have the option of forfeiting your appointment or getting a one color manicure
