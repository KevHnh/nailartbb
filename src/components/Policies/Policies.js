        <div className="sub1">
          Appointments are booked back to back in a time sensitive manner,
          Therefore, late arrivals of 10 minutes or more may result in
          rescheduling, or adjustin gthe service altogether. If its your first
          time coming, please make yourself familiar with the area well before
          your appointment. I understand that situation may come up, but it will
          be up to my discretion if the service can be completed at that time. I
          cannot guarantee your service can be completed if you are late, if
          this is the case you will need to reschedule your appointment and will
          be charged the full price for the service missed. If you are going to
          be late, PLEASE LET ME KNOW AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE by emailing me at
          bb.love.nails92@gmail.com

          equipment and small objects that are not appropiate for children to be
          around. It is distractiong for me to do my work, and need all of my
          attention on you. If you bring your child your appointment will be
          cancelled on the spot and you will not recieve your deposit back. It
